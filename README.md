### team-solve

Investigate and solve problems using a team of specialist agents. Decomposes a problem into parallel investigation tracks, synthesizes findings, then implements solutions serially (or in parallel when safe).

**Workflow:**
1. **Investigate** — parallel teammates each own a problem/theme
2. **Discuss** — review findings, revise scope if needed
3. **Implement** — investigators solve their own problems
4. **Validate** — fresh teammate verifies everything
